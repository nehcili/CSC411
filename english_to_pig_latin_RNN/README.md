# Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation
based on http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment3.pdf

- The goal of this project is to translate a sentence in english to pig latin
- Pytorch is used to implement the following machine learning algorithms:
    - RNN
    - Gated recurrent unit
    - Attention based RNN
    - Additive and scaled product attention
    - Causal scaled dot attention
